Moug is a **reflex game** using the **mouse** where you try to survive multiple **rapid-fire minigames**!

With this **work-in-progress** Pygame project, I'm learning how to use classes effectively and I actively experiment with new graphical techniques! :D

## Instructions
- Use ``mouse`` to navigate UI, and follow by-minigame instructions on where to place your cursor! (e.g. hovering over the moving white circle, avoiding colored lines,...)

Since the game is still in developement and levels not having been implemented yet:
- Switch mini-game mode with ``arrow keys``.
